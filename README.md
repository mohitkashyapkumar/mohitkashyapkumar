Under This Project I have created  
1. HTML (index.html)
2. CSS (Style.css) I used CSS as styling part!!
3. JS (Script.JS)
4. Some png images used to decorate

Made basic structure using HTML.
1.  Search BOX with LOcation and city based including Recent cities dropbox.
2.  Main section to show weather of the city
3.  Forcast section to show the coming 3-days Forcast

USED CSS as:
1. Styling webpages
2. Used Icons as png where it should be used.
3. Some png used by API its self as its documentation described in it.
4. Made the webpage responsive for mobile devices and other short screen devices

!! ---------  API USed in this Project _____!!

So, i used api from RApid api (which is weatherapi.com)

It will fetch the data by USer input and current location also shows 3-days forcast.


Now, coming to JS part, I wrote JS in this project based on what i learned during classes, 
also whenever i got stuck, I used online resourses to learn and then again implement it on my project.
